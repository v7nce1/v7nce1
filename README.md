# Hey there 👋  

I'm Vince, a grade 11 student and app developer based in Canada.

I design and build systems — from immersive games to structured network labs.

If an idea challenges me, I build it.

My main focus areas are Linux, C++, Java, Python networking (CCNA), and scalable system design.  
Favorite tools: Unreal Engine 5, Git, Cisco Packet Tracer, and a lot of whiteboard thinking.

I’ve built competitive game prototypes like **TeleClash**, accessibility-focused control systems, and structured networking labs.

If you're interested in ambitious student projects, game systems, or infrastructure thinking — welcome.
